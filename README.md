# KeywordApplication
A simple Python application for searching keywords in Google Trends. 
Excel is a Microsoft product that is very commonly used in professional settings, as well as for educational and personal workflows. It should be no surprise if you run into this application as a Python programmer. Depending on what you are programming, it may be handy to know more about how to interact with excel files in Python.
Google Trends tracks search analytics for the Google Search Engine. We will use an unofficial API named pytrends to get the data we need for this project.
I will get keyword data from Google Trends and then I will display the data in Microsoft Excel. I will use the tkinter module to give the user a nice GUI (Graphical User Interface) to input the search word. I will be using PyCharm Professional for this project.
